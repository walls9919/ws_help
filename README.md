Help command to bring up Tailwind UI which displays commands and keybinds default to their script

# Read before use
This script is nowhere close to being finished. Its a thing that I've thought a long time to make this and now I've decided to make it and release the code to public so other people can also contribute to it!
If anybody wants they can create their own script useing my idea and share it with me since I'm in desperate need of this script :D

# Purpose of the "release"
To learn more about coding overall since I am a beginner in coding and maybe even pursue it later in life.
I do coding when I'm bored out of my mind and have nothing else to do so don't hope for fast updates.
This also came to my attention that in my FiveM server players kept asking what button does what, now when this gets ready everyone can just use the command that you have set in the code.

# Known issues
~~* Cursor wont show~~
~~* Player can move when the UI is displayed~~
* First time joiners don't get the UI displayed automatically after creating their character
~~* UI is too big (Should be a little thinner so you could actually see what is going on in the background)~~
* UI Opens as soon as you start the script, no way to close it but stop the script
* Text bubbles should be sexier
* Ensure the entire UI adjusts to fit within the UI size, eliminating the need for scrolling to see keybinds/commands that may be currently off-screen.
